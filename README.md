Task 1: Scan Your Local Network for Open Ports
🎯 Objective
Learn to discover open ports on devices in your local network to understand network exposure and basic cybersecurity risks.

🛠️ Tools Used
Nmap – Network scanning and reconnaissance
Wireshark (optional) – Packet analysis
Kali Linux Terminal
📘 Concepts Learned
Network reconnaissance using IP ranges (/24)
TCP SYN scanning and open port enumeration
Service identification and basic risk analysis
Optional packet inspection with Wireshark
🧠 Conclusion
This task helped reinforce the foundational skills of port scanning, identifying active hosts, and recognizing potential security exposures in a network environment. It also builds a critical understanding of how threat actors perform reconnaissance — and how defenders can detect and mitigate risks.
